This project is my first E-commerce website using Javascript, Reactjs.
While building it I've learned many advanced React & JavaScript topics, as well as how to use Stripe for card transactions. On top of that, you will have this unique and complex webshop app that you will be able to add to your portfolio. And trust me, e-commerce applications are impressive.
